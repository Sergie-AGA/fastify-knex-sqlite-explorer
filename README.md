# fastify-knex-sqlite-explorer
The goal of this project is to explore backend possibilities based on a stack using fastify and flavours of sql.
The idea is to comprise a few different projects to explore variations of backend implementations. There will always be a first approach to a technology which is based on a course teaching the concepts, then where desired, there will be a custom implementation of a tech stack where a project is created based on the learned concepts
1. Knex, SQLite and automated tests
2. Prisma, PostgreSQL and automated tests

## Courses Vs. Personal Projects
This repos includes both projects based on courses and personal implementations of the learned stack. Here is a breakdown of them:

### Course projects:
- Knex + SQLite transactions
- Prisma + PostgreSQL gym registration and check-in control

### Personal projects:
- tba

## Goals project 1:
[X] - Learn how to do a basic crud API with the stack\
[X] - Add automated tests\
Conclusions: Limited stack, will not be investing on this further.

## Goals project 2:
[ ] - Learn how to do a basic crud API with stack and apply SOLID principles\
[ ] - Add automated tests\
[ ] - Add custom functionality based on the learned topics\
[ ] - Add a frontend to it\
